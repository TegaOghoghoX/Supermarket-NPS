- Net Promoter Score (NPS): The calculated NPS value indicates the overall satisfaction level of customers. Positive NPS signifies more promoters than detractors, implying higher satisfaction.
- Distribution of Promoters, Passives, and Detractors: Analyze the percentages of each category to understand the distribution of customer sentiment.
- Trend Analysis: Track NPS over time or across different customer segments (e.g., by branch, product line) to identify patterns or areas for improvement.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare NPS across different branches, cities, customer types, or product lines to pinpoint areas needing attention or improvement.
